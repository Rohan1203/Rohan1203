## 👋 Hi there, I'm Rohan!

💻 I'm passionate about **building infrastructure**, **designing scalable systems**, and writing efficient code in **Go (Golang)**.

🚀 With experience spanning **system design**, **backend development**, and **DevOps**, I love crafting tools and platforms that are fast, reliable, and maintainable.

🛠️ I enjoy working at the intersection of infrastructure and application — whether it's writing CLIs, automating deployments, or optimizing service performance.
